# Functional Programming in Erlang

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joelwallis/on-fp-in-erlang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joelwallis/on-fp-in-erlang)

> **SPOILER ALERT: this repository contains solutions for the FutureLearn's Erlang course exercises!**
>
> **If you're one of its students like me, I recommend you to avoid reading solutions of problems and/or homework you haven't completed yourself.**

This repository holds the work produced during FutureLearn's Erlang course, started on May 4, 2020, with an expected duration of 5 weeks. Projects and homework will reside in its own directories and will co-exist in this repository as distinguished/separated Erlang projects.

I'll change this README file with building and usage instructions as soon as a learn it myself.
