# Recursion examples

https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-erlang/3/steps/488096

**The following exercises are designed to demonstrate your capability to use recursion and evaluation by hand in a number of practical examples.**

## Fibonacci numbers

The Fibonacci sequence is given by `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, …` where subsequent values are given by adding the two previous values in the sequence.

Give a recursive definition of the function `fib/1` computing the Fibonacci numbers, and give a step-by-step evaluation of `fib(4)`.

## How many pieces?

Define a function pieces so that `pieces(N)` tells you the maximum number of pieces into which you can cut a piece of paper with `N` straight line cuts.

You can see an illustration of this problem at the top of this step.

If you’d like to take this problem further, think about the 3-dimensional case. Into how many pieces can you cut a wooden block with `N` saw cuts?

Taking it even further: What is the general problem in n dimensions?

Once you have tried solving these problems, why not discuss your approaches to these exercises, and how you went about solving them, on the comments section of this step?

In the next step we’ll present some feedback, where we’ll discuss the repeated computation in the evaluation of `fib(4)` and also discuss the challenging problem of `N` cuts in a piece of paper.
